### Motivations

As part of my 1st project during my bootcamp at General Assembly, I decided to build this Whack-a-Mole based game.
The idea is to place the game on a landing page for a non profit organisation which helps keep coastal area free from sea waste. Methods like Functions, EventListeners, DOM Manupulations, onClick functions and Intervals were used in this project.

### TO-DOs
